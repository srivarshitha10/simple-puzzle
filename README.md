1. Try Your Math!!
2. Memory Check!!
3. Booked your Show??

### Try Your Math!!
- When the window loads we call the “init” function which sets random numbers and an operator between them which are then displayed on our webpage.
-  When the user clicks the get started button he is able to fill the blank appeared using his mathematical skills.
- If the answer is similar to the solution then we display the win message and stop execution. Finally, we define a function for the “Restart” button to restart the game.
###  Memory Check!!
- There are 16 blocks in a grid in this game, and each block has a picture concealed behind it.
- The timer will begin when the user presses the start button.He chooses a block first, then uses his vision and memory to look for another block that has the same picture hidden behind it. 
- The timer will be advanced if the guess is incorrect and moves will also be counted.
### Booked your Show??
- This puzzle is based on the movie knowledge a user has and his ability to grab things from pictorial representation.
- Some emojis will be displayed and 5 tries are given in case of incorrect alphabet guessing.
### Arrange Fast!!
- This puzzle is based on users fastness and logical ability in arranging the numbers.
- When play button is selected a grid of 16 blocks with 15 numbers jumbled and an empty block is displayed.
- User can move the empty block once and try to arrange the numbers in order. Number of moves and time taken will be incremented.
### Sudoku
- This is similar to a general sudoku puzzle that assess the user's logical ability to arrange the numbers under the conditions.
- An incorrect guess will me marked if the guessed number doesn't satisfy the conditions.

- The user is provided with 5 chances. If the user guesses 5 wrong letters he loses the game. And we display the answer to the game on the end screen.
